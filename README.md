```
I cannot focus on
anything but you baby
I cannot focus on
anything but you
초점 뒤의 흐릿한
반투명한 My view baby
I cannot focus on anything,
on anyone but you
프레임 속에 널 넣으면
You so amazing amazing
amazing amazing
선명한 My subject
그 톤을 만져, 더 얕은,
엿보듯, 널 담은
The look
내 눈은 오토 포커스
그 감각대로 프로듀스
세상 빼기 너
그건 재미없어
넌 내 안에 있어 Yeah
I cannot focus on
anything but you baby
I cannot focus on
anything but you
초점 뒤의 흐릿한
반투명한 My view baby
I cannot focus on anything,
on anyone but
You you you you you
살아나는
View view view view view
Anything but
you you you you you
너 말곤
Adieu dieu dieu dieu dieu
B-side 숨겨놓은
한쪽의 Phrasing, the phrasing
the phrasing the phrasing
둘 사이 거리를
좁혔다 넓혀, So random,
네 반응, My pleasure
It's you
내 시선의 중심
세상을 뒤로 미는 중
어디로 가니
널 잃지 않을래
I got tunnel vision yeah
I cannot focus on
anything but you baby
I cannot focus on
anything but you
초점 뒤의 흐릿한
반투명한 My view baby
I cannot focus on anything,
on anyone but
(You)
(View)
(Adieu)
I cannot focus
You're all I'm needing
I cannot focus
You're all I'm seeing
I cannot focus
You're all I'm needing
I cannot focus
You're all I'm seeing
I cannot focus
You're all I'm needing
I cannot focus
You're all I'm seeing
I cannot focus
You're all I'm needing
I cannot focus
You're all I'm seeing
