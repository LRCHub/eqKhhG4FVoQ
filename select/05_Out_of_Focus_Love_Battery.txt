And take my world and tear it apart
I can't beleive what I've done
Put my pride in a mess
I can't stand it when you wear that dress
You've been right, the things you say
Why don't you just go away?
I've been diggin' for tonight, I've been diggin' for July

The rings around, the rings so sweet
Beside your mind in the summer heat
I can't belive the things I've said
Between your eyes, between your legs
Words then can break in half
Make you mad, they make you laugh
Then they crawl into the sea
The endless rythm into your.

Our dreams are all out of focus
Knock you up when your feeling down
And all the world seems so unreal

Why should I lean on the street
And shadows cast for sympathy
Sores on your hands and knees
I can't belive, I can't belive
Now that my patience is slim
When summer comes I'll take it in
Notice my pain can swim
I'm drowning in the words it brings

Our dreams are all out of focus
Knock you up when your feeling down
And all the world seems so unreal

(I doubt these lyrics are right,
But it was the best I could do trying
To understand what he was saying)
