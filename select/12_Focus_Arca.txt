Focus
Come on, focus
Focus
Pause

Focus, tell me what you want
You gotta stay present, take care
It scared me now more than ever that you want it
I may deliver overnight
Forget moderation, fuck hesitation, oh
For the, for the part, so, smoke up, I choke on

Shit was non-stop, blood let too
It's the fade, non-stop
What took you so long?
I thought you'd never wake up
I must be the make-up
Hope I never wake up
Never take the mask off
There's no pause
It was so heavy
You gotta stop
It's movin' slow

Sendin' signals, the best of ways
Now you got a fade, hope it never fades
But this isn't how my mother raised me, I'm a changed man
New taste for bloodlettin'
Watchin' movies in the dark
Cold sweat, can't stop my heartbeat, blood let, this might

Fuck what you mean, I deliver the beat
Time is your focus
You load up, you bag it all up
Time is of the essence, the presence is defenseless
Don't play, time to play, top to my surprise
Oh, wow, the sunrise, now look back to my eyes
My eyes, focus on 'em

Shit was non-stop, blood let too
It's the fade, non-stop
What took you so long?
I thought you'd never wake up
I must be the make-up
Hope I never wake up
I'mma take the mask off
No pause
(It was so heavy 'cause we have liftoff)
Movin' slow
Movin' slow
This time it's so
Movin' slow

Fuck what you mean, I deliver the beat
Time is your focus
You load up, you bag it all up
Time is not the essence, the presence is defenseless
Don't be late, time to play, top to my surprise
Oh, wow, the sunrise, now look back to my eyes

Shit was non-stop, blood let too
It's the fade, non-stop
What took you so long?
I thought you'd never wake up
I must be the make-up
Hope I never wake up
Take the mask off
Well somehow
Bruised arms and legs
We have liftoff from the flo'
(We're really slow)
