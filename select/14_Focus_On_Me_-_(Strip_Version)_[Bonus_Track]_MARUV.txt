You'd better focus, focus, focus on me
You'd better focus, focus, focus on me
You'd better focus, focus, focus on me
You'd better focus

You're under, under, under my skin
I want you, want you, want you to come in
I'll show you, show you, show you right here
What you're doin' to me
Come here

Do you feel the same strong attraction?
Now I'm looking on the aim, your direction
Now pretty pretty girl pay your attention
Pay your attention
Do you feel the same strong attraction?
Now I'm looking on the aim, your direction
Now pretty pretty girl pay your attention

You'd better focus on me

You'd better focus on me

You'd better focus on me

You'd better focus on me

Pull in, pull in, pull in so fast
Explodin' like a bomb such a blast
You'll show me, show me, show me tonight
What you've got on your mind
Hold tight

I hit this hottest guy in the city
Checkin' out my ass, damn i'm pretty
Wanna have some fun, don't you, sweetie?
Don't you, sweetie?
